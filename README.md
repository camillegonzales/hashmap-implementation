# HashMap Implementation

## No use of Python's built-in functions or data structures
This program is deliberately implemented without relying on built-in Python functions or data structures
to showcase my proficiency in low-level programming, algorithm design, and problem-solving.

## The HashMap is implemented in two forms:
1. Using Separate Chaining
2. Via Open Addressing with Quadratic Probing
